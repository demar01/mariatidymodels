# mariatidymodels R

The objective of this package is to have a sandbox to explore and create my own functions around `tidymodels` framework and documented with `pkgdown` and github pages.

### How I created this project

1.  I started a new project ([GitHub first](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html))
2.  I cloned my project using [GitHub Desktop](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html)
3.  I set up [pkgdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C7-fYyjLH0) with Github pages.
4.   :rocket: Ready to go!
